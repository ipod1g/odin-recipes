        <h2>Lebanese Chicken Shawarma</h2>
        <p>
            Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food that
             is made with very thin slices of meat, stacked in a 
             cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly-turning 
             vertical spit. These thin slices of meat are then 
             shaved and served on pita bread wraps. 
             Shawarma can be made with lamb, beef or chicken.
